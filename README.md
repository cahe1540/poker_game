### About

I constructed this project so that I may practice my programmign abilities. I originally wrote the game code using java. I later translated it to javascript and designed
a simple HTML UI. [view project](https://cahe1540.github.io/poker_game/)

### Description

This project implements some ideas of object oriented programming. The most basic class in this program is the Card class. From the Card class, a Hand class, and a Deck class
can be built. A Player class is then constructed and given Hand and other attributes to store a player's information information. Lastly, the Game class is created and
keeps track of an active game of poker.

I create a simple, responsive, HTML UI for this version of the game. This app uses DOM manipulation to update the UI and is my first attempt at implementing the model view
controller(MVC) model. There is a main controller class that controls all. The main controller class communicates with the game class and the UI class to run the game.
